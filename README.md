Migration Analysis for Class

A study on Millennial migration patterns in the United States.

We set out to find answers to the question of whether or not Millenials are moving out of major American cities. Seeing that Millennials are, in fact, leaving some of the biggest cities in the country, we looked for what motivates the decision to leave cultural hubs and hot job markets. Next, we asked where people are moving to and why they seem to choose those locales. We were able to aggregate data from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the F.B.I. to find that Millennials aren't leaving cities, they're just leaving expensive ones.

Contained in this repository are jupyter notebook files showing methodology. We've included csv file datasets from the above mentioned government bodies as well, though some data was obtained through API pulls. A Google slides presentation can be found at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ub8Y7JnjE7OgJpPfIGS2XTx1zwjOByCbgrc32V0Hhv8/edit?usp=sharing detailing the analysis we performed to come to our conclusions.

Our findings were that Millennials do want to remain in cities. The cities people are moving to do not offer more culture or job opportunities and they aren't the best places to raise families (based on crime statistics and education investment). Rather, what is driving people out of Chicago and New York and into Salt Lake City and Austin is pure affordability.
